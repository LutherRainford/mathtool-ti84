# Mathtool
This is a program for the TI 84 Plus CE graphing calculator that I created in 6th grade and that I've added things to every once and a while since. It has numerous useful functions for all levels of mathematics that range from finding the side of a triangle to Euler's Method. 

Written in TI-BASIC
